# AI Game Playing – Teeko (Minimax Agent)

This project implements an intelligent game-playing agent for **Teeko**, a two-player abstract strategy board game.  
The agent uses **adversarial search (minimax)** combined with a **custom heuristic evaluation function** to make optimal decisions under uncertainty and limited search depth.

The implementation demonstrates core concepts in **artificial intelligence, game theory, and decision-making algorithms**, including state-space search, opponent modeling, and heuristic design.

## Problem Overview

Teeko is played on a 5×5 board with two phases:

1. **Drop Phase** – Players alternately place pieces on empty squares until 8 total pieces are on the board.
2. **Move Phase** – Players move their pieces one square at a time to adjacent empty spaces.

A player wins by forming:
- Four in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), **or**
- A 2×2 box of their pieces.

The challenge is to design an AI that:
- Plans ahead while accounting for an adversarial opponent
- Evaluates non-terminal board positions effectively
- Handles both placement and movement phases correctly

## Technical Approach

### 1. Minimax with Depth Cutoff
- The agent uses **minimax search** to model the game as a zero-sum, turn-based adversarial problem.
- A fixed **depth limit** is applied to control computational complexity.
- Terminal states (wins/losses) are evaluated exactly; non-terminal states use a heuristic.

### 2. Heuristic Evaluation Function
For non-terminal game states, a custom heuristic estimates board favorability by:
- Scanning all possible winning patterns:
  - 4-in-a-row lines (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
  - 2×2 box configurations
- Measuring the **best partial pattern** for the AI versus the opponent
- Penalizing blocked lines and rewarding uncontested progress

The heuristic returns a normalized score reflecting how close the AI is to winning relative to the opponent.

### 3. Successor Generation
- During the **drop phase**, successors are generated by placing a piece on any empty square.
- During the **move phase**, successors are generated by moving any existing piece to an adjacent empty square.
- All successor states are created using **deep copies** to preserve state integrity.

### 4. Opponent Modeling
- The opponent is treated as a minimizing agent in minimax.
- The AI explicitly assumes optimal opponent play when evaluating future states.
